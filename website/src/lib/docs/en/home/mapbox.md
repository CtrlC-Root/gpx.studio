Mapbox is the company that provides some of the beautiful maps on this website.
They also develop the <a href="https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-js" target="_blank">map engine</a> which powers *gpx.studio*.

We are incredibly lucky and grateful to have joined their <a href="https://mapbox.com/community" target="_blank">Community</a> program, which supports nonprofits, educational institutions, and positive impact organizations.
This means that *gpx.studio* can benefit from Mapbox tools at discounted prices, which greatly contributes to the financial viability of the project and to offering the best possible user experience.
