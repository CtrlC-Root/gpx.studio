[Mapbox](https://mapbox.com) is the company that provides some of the beautiful maps on this website.
They also develop the [map engine](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-js) which powers *gpx.studio*.
We are incredibly lucky and grateful to have joined their [Community](https://www.mapbox.com/community) program, which supports nonprofits, educational institutions, and positive impact organizations.
This means that *gpx.studio* can benefit from Mapbox tools at discounted prices, which greatly contributes to the financial viability of the project and to offering the best possible user experience.
