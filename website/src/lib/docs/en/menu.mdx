The main menu, located at the top of the interface, provides access to actions, options and settings divided into several categories:
- [File actions](./menu/file)
- [Edit actions](./menu/edit)
- [View options](./menu/view)
- [Settings](./menu/settings)

    Most of the menu actions can also be performed using keyboard shortcuts that are displayed in the menu.
